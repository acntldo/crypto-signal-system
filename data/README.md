# 📊 Dataset Information

This folder contains the historical cryptocurrency dataset used for training and evaluating the machine learning model.

---

## 📁 File Included

### top_100_cryptos_with_correct_network.csv
This dataset contains historical OHLC (Open, High, Low, Close) data for multiple cryptocurrencies across different time periods.

---

## 🧠 Purpose of the Dataset
The dataset is used for:
- Training the ML model for signal prediction
- Feature engineering (moving averages, momentum, RSI, volatility)
- Backtesting trading strategies
- Simulating market behavior for inference

---

## 📌 Data Structure
Each row represents a single time interval for a cryptocurrency.

### Columns:
- symbol → trading pair (e.g. BTCUSDT)
- date → timestamp of market data
- open → opening price
- high → highest price during period
- low → lowest price during period
- close → closing price
- network → blockchain category (e.g. Bitcoin, Ethereum)

## 🧪 Usage in Project

The dataset is processed in the backend to:
1. Generate technical indicators
2. Create feature vectors for ML model
3. Train classification model (BUY / HOLD / SELL)
4. Support prediction API
